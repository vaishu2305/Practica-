    <h2>Origin of life and evolution on Earth</h2>
        <p>The universe is very old – almost 13 billion years old. Huge clusters of galaxies comprise the universe. The Big Bang theory attempts to explain to us the origin of universe. It talks of a singular huge explosion unimaginable in physical terms. The universe expanded and hence, the temperature came down. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later.The gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the present day universe.In the solar system of the milky way galaxy, earth was supposed to have been formed about 5 billion years back.There was no atmosphere on early earth. Methane, carbondioxide and ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface.The UV rays from the sun brokeup water into Hydrogen and Oxygen and the lighter H<sub>2</sub> escaped. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water, CO<sub>2</sub> and others.The ozone layer was formed. As earth cooled, the water vapor fell as rain, to fill all the depressions and form oceans.Life appeared 500 million years after the formation of earth, i.e., almost four billion years back. Some scientists believe that the life came from outerspace.The first non-cellular forms of life could have originated 3 billion years back. They would have been giant molecules (RNA, Protein, Polysaccharides, etc.). These capsules reproduced their molecules perhaps.The first cellular form of life did not possibly originate till about 2000 million years ago. These were probably single-cells. All life forms were in water environment only.The version of a biogenesis, i.e., the first form of life arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules is accepted by majority.</p>

        <p>The timeline of life on earth begins over 4.5 billion years ago. In the beginning, survival was difficult for any life forms. The struggle started and soon after earth’s formation, organisms start appearing.  It makes sense the first signs of life on planet earth are incredibly simple.The earliest fossil evidence of life on earth dates to 3.7 billion years ago. They were found preserved in ancient rock samples from Greenland. The fossils were once part of a now-extinct seabed and thought to be the remains of ancient microbes.These anaerobic organisms lived in the absence of oxygen. They process the other chemicals that were abundant in the early atmosphere and oceans. The efforts of these microbes created the conditions for all other life to evolve across the earth.</p>
            
         <h3><i>The evolution of diverse life on earth</i></h3> 
         <p>After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion" target="_blank">Cambrian explosion</a>, life on earth was climbing in diversity. Many new species of plants and animals separate onto a path of evolution. New forms of life began to appear.Plants began colonizing the land, and fish began swimming in the seas. The first life on land started as algae gradually adapted to be able to live on dry land.Around 400 million years ago, the first four-legged animals started to develop. These animals, known as tetrapods, are the ancestors to all birds, mammals, reptiles and even amphibians.The first amphibians appear soon after, living on sea floors and in shallow marine ecologies. They were the first species to branch off from the tetrapods.Insects are next, although they took some time to develop wings.Then reptiles developed in swamps and tropical forests, which were mainly made up of ferns and other ancient coniferous plants. </p>

         <p>At 300 million years ago, many species were living in many ecologies. Reptiles especially thrive both on land and in water.The first aquatic reptile to exist was known as a Mesosaur. It preyed on amphibians and other sea creatures. Scientists don’t know why this ancient predator diverged from its fellow reptiles and returned to the ocean.The most well-known land-dwelling ancient reptiles were the Dimetrodon. This early predator had an appearance much like a dinosaur. However, the last remains of a dimetrodon have been dated to 40 million years before dinosaurs walked the earth.</p>

         <p>250 million years ago marked the first emergence of dinosaurs. They were pre-empted by a mass extinction event that shattered all life on earth. Around a third of life on planet earth was wiped out, marking a huge fork in the timeline of life on earth. Yet, as life has shown to do throughout history, it continued on living.The dinosaurs weren’t initially the dominant species on the planet. It would take 50 million years to take over the entire planet.</p>

         <p>In the late Triassic, 200 million years ago, the first mammals appear. It was soon after the dinosaurs became the dominant species on earth. These mammals were very small, many no larger than mice. Here the first warm-bloodedness mammals appear in the record. In the timeline of life on earth, mammals began splitting into the four major groups that can be observed today. It’s not known why it happened.Today, it’s unknown exactly when, but around this era saw the emergence of the first birds. They are thought to have split from dinosaurs or reptiles. How and when is still a mystery.A0s all of this was unfolding in the animal kingdom, plant species across the world were diversifying rapidly. The first signs of flowering plants are linked to this time as the evolution of the planet flourished.</p>
