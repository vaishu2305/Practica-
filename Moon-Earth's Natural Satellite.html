    <h2>Moon-Earth's Natural Satellite</h2>
    <p>The Moon that orbits the Earth is simply known as The Moon because for many centuries, it was the only moon that we were aware of and could see. The Moon is believed to have been created soon after the Earth was born. A planetoid called Theia smashed into the Earth and the debris flew off into space and eventually clumped together and became the Moon as we know it.The Moon as you can see from the picture below is pock-marked, thousands of craters have been formed, some during the creation and some over time. The Moon has been a barrier, protecting the Earth from attacks from meteors that could have created a mass extinction. The Moon does rotate but does so ever so slowly that you only get to see one side of the Moon.</p>

    <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia),it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of a major planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g); Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.</p>

    <p>Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. That said, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through shifts in perspective due to libration.</p>
    <p>Moon is one of the many natural planetary satellite moons of the planet Earth. The moon was discovered in Unknown by Known by the Ancients. The mass of the object is 73,476,730,924,573,500,000,000 kg. The equatorial circumference of the Moon is 10,917.0 km. The semi-major axis of the orbit around its planet is 384,400 km. The density of the Moon is 3.344 g/cm3. The orbit circumference, that is the total journey round the planet is 2,413,402.16 km.The average orbit velocity/speed of Moon is 3,680.5 km/h. The Orbit Eccentricity is 0.0554, that is how much the orbit deviates from a circle, between 0 and 1. The Orbit Inclination is 5.16 degrees, that is how much the orbit deviates from a circle, between 0 and 1. The average orbit mean radius of Moon is 1737.5 km. The circumference of the Moon at the equator is 10,917.0 km. The volume of Moon at the equator is 21,971,669,064 km3. The surface area of the object is 37,936,694.79 km2.The escape velocity, the speed which is need to break free is 8,552 km/h. The surface gravity of Moon is 1.624 m/s2 compared to Earth which for purpose of this site is 1. The sidereel rotation period, the time it takes for the Moon to rotate once is 27.322 Earth days. More information and the source for the Moon can be found at N.A.S.A.</p>

    <i><u><h4>Internal Structure</h4></u></i>
    <p>The Moon is a differentiated body that was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium but has since departed from this condition.[62] It has a geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 kilometres (150 mi) and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 kilometres (190 mi). Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 kilometres (310 mi).This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon's formation 4.5 billion years ago.</p>

    <p>Crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust a top.The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.Consistent with this perspective, geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests a crust of mostly anorthosite.The Moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition, which is more iron-rich than that of Earth.The crust is on average about 50 kilometres (31 mi) thick.</p>
        
    <p>he Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io.However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 kilometres (220 mi) or less,[1] around 20% of the radius of the Moon. Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5 GPa (49,000 atm).</p>>
